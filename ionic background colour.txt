<ion-content padding class="masters">
  <ion-list inset>
    <button ion-item *ngFor="#master of masterPages" (click)="navMaster(master)">
      {{master.title}}
    </button>
  </ion-list>
</ion-content>

Then in your scss you target the class in the ion-content tag:

.masters {
  background-color: green;
}


Lastly you make sure this scss is being compiled with your app.core.scss by importing it in that same file like:

@import "../pages/masters/masters";
